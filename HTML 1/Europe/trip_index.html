      <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
      <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!</p>
      <p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>

      <a class = "noline" href="Italy/italy.html">
      <div class="box">
      <h2>Italy</h2>
      <p>We loved Italy! From the ancient ruins to the beautiful scenery and delicious food, we still have many wonderful memories.</p>

      <div class="box">
      <h2>Greece</h2>
      <p>Greece was a stunning surprise. We stayed in Crete for a week and were seduced by the scenery, history and the sheer friendliness of the locals.</p>
      <p>We also spent time in Athens, marvelling at many of the ancient ruins.</p>
      </div>
      <a class = "noline" href="France/france.html".html">
      <div class="box">
      <h2>France</h2>
      <p>We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.</p>
      <p>Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.</p>
      <p>We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.</p>
